* Build system rewritten (NOTICE: configure options was modified). 
* None privileged configuration added, as a result /etc/openct.conf ifdhandler
  was modified, please review sample at etc/openct.conf before upgrade.
* The usb device add (/dev/bus/usb/$env{BUSNUM}/$env{DEVNUM}) udev rule is now
  available in separate file, as it should be available at most distributions,
  and may conflict. Install this only if you are using old udev that miss this
  statement.

* udev scripts for usb, pcmcia_block and serial readers.
* add several usb ids to ccid driver config.

* don't claim interface in device_open, instead make sure all drivers
  call ifd_device_set_parameters which will (in the case of usb) claim
  the interface.
* cleanup the parameters to ifdhandler and openct-control attach.
  include type of the device in these parameters. do not drop the
  type if already known. this change requires the updated hotplug files.

New in 0.6.8; 2006-06-19; Andreas Jellinghaus
Fix bug in socket code: retry if read() returns -1/EINTR.

New in 0.6.7; 2006-05-01; Andreas Jellinghaus
* configure.ac uses now pkg-config.
* sys-linux.c does not need kernel headers (all data etc. included)
* now generating a Changelog file in the documentation

* new smartkey driver: not finished yet
* support for both /proc/bus/usb and /dev/bus/usb devices with linux
* improved T=1 implementation by Ludovic Rousseau
* improved eutron driver by Chaskiel Grundman
* OPENCT_SOCKETDIR environment can point to any dir for the sockets so
  users can use it without being root.
* sample config files for both hald and udev.
  we suggest udev as hotplug replacement. hald is not tested.
* sample reader.conf included for pcsc-lite.
  remember to use opensc->openct or opensc->pcsc->openct but not both.
* add phoenix/smartmouse driver by Antoine Nguyen
  based on sctk by Alexandre Becoulet
* License is now officialy LGPL. So far it was BSD/LGPL
  dual licensed, and most parts still are, but we already
  had some usb code under LGPL and now got another driver
  under LGPL, so the project as whole is considered LGPL.
  Libopenct is still 100% BSD, in case you want to use it.
  so this only affects the ifdhandler process and other tools.
